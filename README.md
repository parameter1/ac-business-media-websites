# Developing

## Docker Compose

To get started, execute the `./scripts/yarn.sh` file to install this projects dependencies. Once complete, use the relevant docker-compose service name with the Docker compose `up` command:

```sh
docker compose up fl
docker compose up fcp
docker compose up gip
docker compose up oem
docker compose up sso
docker compose up sdc
```

## Native Node.JS
To use in a native node environment, run `yarn` from the project root, then use the `dev` command of the `basecms-website` CLI from the site folder:
```sh
yarn install --pure-lockfile
cd sites/foodlogistics.com
./node_modules/.bin/basecms-website dev index.js
```

Note the default values currently specified for each service within the docker-compose file -- these values must be present within your `env` in order to successfully boot the project!
